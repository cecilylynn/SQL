-- UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to 
-- call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's claims and benefits support, 
-- drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

-- Write a query to find how many UHG policy holders made three, or more calls, assuming each call is 
-- identified by the case_id column.

  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) >= 3
